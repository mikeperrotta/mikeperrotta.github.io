    works well with any number of players. The downside is that someone has
    to sit out during the game to collect all the answers and make up fake answers.
    I had been wanting to create an app with React Native for a while,

    One decision that saved me time was to design a logo without putting
    too much thought into making it perfect. It could be improved, but I
    created a design which isnâ€™t too bad and then got to work on the app
